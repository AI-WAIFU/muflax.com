Spent most of my productive hours reading the [Luke/Ben debate][LW luke/ben] and thinking about it, which was fun, but probably not a good use of my time. (I'm updating further away from Luke. Also, wtf psi? Bloody synchronicity.)

Rest of the day? Diablo 2. Dammit. (Good thing I have 300 words/day *on average*.)
