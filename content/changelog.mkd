All major changes on the site
=============================

{:#changelog}
- 2011/09/04: Converted whole site to [nanoc][]. Most of the content got
  re-organized, but not widely changed. A few things have disappeared, but will
  probably come back in a better form later. The design is reasonably the same,
  with some minor tweaks. The navigation bar is now at the bottom to deal with
  some footnote issues.

  Every page has an [Epistemic State][] now. This is an important step to
  convert this into proper long-term content. Sites are also dated now, so that
  some obviously out-dated material is clearly visible as such (and new material
  is obvious on the main page).
  
  I added the story [Milinda and the Minotaur][] I wrote some time ago, but
  never felt like publishing. Thanks to [epistemic states][Epistemic State]
  though, I now can.
  
  I do plan articles on the Great Filter and languages (use and learning), but
  dunno how long this'll take. For now, this is mostly a setup to make it really
  easy for me to write more stuff and release faster. I have a couple of drafts
  lying around I might revive, particularly a comparison of the [Theravada][]
  path model of enlightenment with the Matrix movie.
  
  (I also threw away the old changelog because it's useless now anyway. Check
  the [git history][Source] if you care.)
