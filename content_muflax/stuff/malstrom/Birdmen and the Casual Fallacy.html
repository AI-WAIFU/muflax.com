					<br>
					Centuries ago, men attempted to fly by putting wings on 
					their arms and flapping really hard. Logically, in their 
					minds, it should have worked. Birds fly. Birds have wings. 
					Therefore, having wings should mean man will fly.<br>
					<br>
					The gentlemen, puffed with pride, 
					failed every time. Had they examined the nature of flight, 
					as opposed to the nature of birds, they would have realized 
					the concept of lift (as Bernoulli did). One must examine the 
					physics of the flight rather than putting feathers on one’s 
					arms in imitation of birds. The descendants of these birdmen 
					are with us today. In the gaming industry, they represent 
					some of the highest gaming executives and esteemed analysts.<br>
					<br>
					Nintendo is flying high. Rather than 
					examine the nature of this flight, the birdmen are 
					mesmerized by the feathers. The analysts and executives do 
					not see the concepts of disruption and don’t even understand 
					the Blue Ocean principles (though they think they do). The 
					feathers they see on Nintendo’s ascent are <i>casual games</i>. 
					Therefore, they surmise, if they make <i>casual games</i> 
					then they will be flying high with Nintendo.<br>
					<br>
					There is nothing new here. Years ago, 
					when <i>Grand Theft Auto 3</i> hit big, all the birdmen 
					began putting out <i>Grand Theft Auto 3</i> clones. Years 
					before that, it was first person shooters. More years before 
					that, it was bloody fighters. One can find the birdmen back 
					in the 8-bit generation making platformers. They would look 
					at <i>Super Mario Brothers</i> and go, “Oh, I get it! We 
					just need to make a game with cute music, colorful world, 
					and upgrades like the <i>magic mushroom</i>!” Slapping wings 
					on their arms, these games flopped. Amazingly, despite how 
					many times the birdmen fall down, each generation they are 
					ready to put on feathers and jump off a cliff.<b><br>
					<br>
					<br>
					How the Casual Fallacy was Born<br>
					<br>
					</b>The game industry was, and still is, 
					distinctively hardcore. They generate their profits from 
					sequels and big blockbuster games. The developers are all 
					hardcore. The publishers are generally hardcore as well.<br>
					<br>
					When a hardcore gamer looks at a 
					hardcore game, he sees <i>sophistication, magnificence, </i>
					and, most important, <i>art</i> as if it were a mirror image 
					facing him. When a hardcore gamer looks as a casual game, he 
					sees <i>simplicity</i>, <i>non-art, easiness, </i>and, in 
					sum, a <i>retardation of gaming.</i> Hardcore view casual 
					games not as progress in gaming but as games tailor made for 
					gaming retards.<br>
					<br>
					“Retards!?” says a shocked reader. 
					“Surely you can’t say what you mean!” Why not? When a casual 
					gamer picks up the standard dual shock controller, he gets 
					confused. He doesn’t have the patience to wade through these 
					elaborate 3d worlds or memorize fourteen button 
					combinations. While the hardcore call him “stupid”, he 
					retaliates by calling gaming “stupid”.<br>
					<br>
					Anytime you read ‘casual games’ in the 
					news, just replace ‘casual’ with the word ‘retard’ and you 
					will get how it is truly perceived by the industry. “There 
					is a casual gamer boom!” should translate to “There is a 
					retard gamer boom!”. The “EA Casual Games Division” really 
					is translated to “EA Retard Games Division”. “Why are you 
					calling casual gamers retarded!?” thunders one reader. I am 
					not. I am saying that the hardcore industry is the one who 
					thinks this way. ‘Casual’ is just a nice way of saying 
					‘dumb’ in their eyes.<br>
					<br>
					The reason why hardcore gamers’ hearts 
					sink when a company says they will make the game include 
					‘casuals’ is because they know that all the edge, 
					difficulty, and passion will be ripped out to make a 
					generic, easy, and soul-less game.<br>
					<br>
					Despite every company and their dog 
					making these ‘casual’ games, the so-called casual audience 
					is not buying them (just as they didn’t buy the platformer 
					clones of the 8-bit generation, the fighter clones of the 
					16-bit generation, the GTA clones of last generation, and so 
					on). When seeing their ‘casual games’ flop while seeing 
					Nintendo’s ‘casual’ games in the bestsellers, the third 
					parties growl and say, “IT IS ALL NINTENDO’S FAULT! People 
					only buy Nintendo games! Third parties can’t succeed on this 
					platform!”<br>
					<br>
					The problem is not in these companies’ 
					execution of their plan. The problem is their world-view. 
					Their perception is totally off, and it is costing these 
					companies millions upon millions of dollars. Don’t you 
					think, guys, that it is time to think about things a littler 
					harder before you waste more millions?<br>
					<br>
					<img src="Birdmen%20and%20the%20Casual%20Fallacy_files/birdman4.jpg" border="0" height="230" width="230"><br>
					<br>
					<b><br>
					There is No Casual Gamer<br>
					<br>
					</b>“What!” echoes someone from the 
					balcony. “If this is true, then what will we use for this 
					generation’s meme? What will our editorialists write about? 
					We have spilled so much ink on this subject and apply the 
					‘casual gaming’ template to every story that comes out. How 
					can we exist without it?”<br>
					<br>
					I do not know nor do I care. Hopefully, 
					you birdmen can become a little more original.<br>
					<br>
					Take the industry of home speakers (as 
					many gamers are familiar with it). There is a wide range of 
					product lines, is there not Mr. Reader?<br>
					<br>
					“That is so,” replied Mr. Reader. 
					“There are very basic, bargain based speakers to the mid 
					range. Then, there is the more expensive high range.”<br>
					<br>
					Very well… So the higher one goes, the 
					more expensive it gets?<br>
					<br>
					“Yes, Mr. Malstrom. Upper tier speakers 
					are EXTREMELY expensive.”<br>
					<br>
					Now tell me, my figment-of-my-words, 
					how does user knowledge act along the product line?<br>
					<br>
					“Well, knowledge is the defining 
					characteristic of the tiers. The more knowledge one has, 
					that means the more audiophile one is, the more likely he or 
					she will reach for the upper tier. At the bottom, the users 
					know little about audio and do not care to know. The ones at 
					the top are very passionate about their audio and will pick 
					out separate speakers and subwoofer just to maximize their 
					experience.”<br>
					<br>
					Are you saying the people on the bottom 
					tier are stupid? Are they just casual listeners?<br>
					<br>
					“Only an upper tier person would define 
					them as ‘casual’. They just don’t have that much passion 
					about audio so they don’t have much knowledge.”<br>
					<br>
					And what creates this passion?<br>
					<br>
					Mr. Reader smiled. “By having audio 
					they want to listen to.”<br>
					<br>
					If there is audio they want to listen 
					to, they will start buying these speakers, become more 
					knowledgeable, and keep upgrading those speakers as they 
					move up to the higher tier?<br>
					<br>
					“Yes.”<b><br>
					<br>
					The Upmarket and the Downmarket<br>
					<br>
					</b>There is no casual gamer. There is no 
					hardcore gamer. There is only the downmarket and the 
					upmarket.<br>
					<br>
					In any type of product, there is a set 
					of obstacles that need to be realized before the product can 
					be enjoyed. Some people, especially technical savvy, can get 
					through these barriers sooner than others.<br>
					<br>
					<img src="Birdmen%20and%20the%20Casual%20Fallacy_files/featuritis.jpg" border="0" height="343" width="440"></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Compare the above graph to users’ 
					experience in game software. The simple games of the Atari 
					days have undeniably become more complex. To those who grew 
					up with video game consoles, they were able to stretch their 
					user peaks. These current players, who call themselves the 
					hardcore, became the upmarket.<br>
					<br>
					Many people did not grow up with video 
					games or kept playing them after the Atari 2600 and NES. 
					Look at the above graph and think of their reaction to 
					playing games today. Obviously, they will be frustrated as 
					they look in the manual, swear at themselves, and generally 
					conclude that gaming isn’t for them. Someone content with <i>
					Pong</i> is not going to ‘jump in’ a huge 3d game world.<br>
					<br>
					When the upmarket views the so-called 
					casual games or even games of the past (such as the classics 
					on the Virtual Console), they are on the left side thinking 
					“Nice, but I wish I could do more…” The games are not 
					elaborate enough for them. In Wii Tennis, the upmarket keeps 
					saying, “The game is nice but I wish I could move my player 
					around myself” or “Wii Play is nice but I wish the games 
					were more elaborate” or “Downloading Mario Kart 64 is nice 
					but I wish I could play it online with new tracks…”<br>
					<br>
					Obviously, the pleasure thresholds of 
					upmarket and downmarket differ (with a variety of different 
					users in the middle). But for simplification purposes, based 
					on these two areas, we get two different paths to user 
					experience:</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">
					<img src="Birdmen%20and%20the%20Casual%20Fallacy_files/kickasscurvetwo.jpg" border="0" height="458" width="444"></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Let me ask you an honest question. Take 
					your favorite games or, rather, the games that put a great 
					first impression on you. How soon were you kicking ass in 
					these games?<br>
					<br>
					Most likely, very soon. Richard 
					Garriott, aka Lord British, revealed many years ago (back 
					when Origin Systems still existed) why <i>Diablo</i> and the 
					RTS games such as Red Alert and Warcraft 2 became so 
					popular. With <i>Diablo</i>, it is because you level up 
					extremely fast at first. You feel like a badass early on 
					which encourages you to go further. The RTS games did the 
					same with the first missions of <i>Warcraft 2</i> and <i>Red 
					Alert</i> as extremely simple (the first <i>Red Alert</i> 
					Soviet mission had the player just point and click to tell 
					planes where to bomb). Anyone who has played <i>World of 
					Warcraft</i> will realize how fast the game makes one feel 
					like a ‘badass’ in the first ten levels of the game. Other 
					MMORPGs start off much slower which would explain their 
					slower sales.<br>
					<br>
					These downmarket users, if properly 
					treated, will travel upstream to become upmarket users. <i>
					World of Warcraft</i> novices often become the most die-hard 
					raiders. Many had <i>Command and Conquer</i> or <i>Warcraft 
					2/Starcraft</i> as their first RTS. They played the simple 
					levels and moved upstream to more sophistication. (It should 
					be noted that <i>World of Warcraft</i>, <i>Warcraft 2, Red 
					Alert</i>, and <i>Diablo</i> are set up to take advantage of 
					this. The first units or choices the player has are small 
					but it branches over time and becomes more complex.) 
					Miyamoto was surprised that the Touch Generation games on 
					the DS had users go upstream to play <i>Mario Kart DS</i> 
					and <i>New Super Mario Brothers</i> (both of which broke 
					sales records).<b><br>
					<br>
					<br>
					The Upstream Games<br>
					<br>
					</b>When you think back to the great classics of gaming, one 
					finds games such as <i>Pac-Man, Super Mario Brothers, Sonic 
					the Hedgehog, Mega Man 2, Dragon Quest, Legend of Zelda, </i>
					among other software. While all these games are obsolete in 
					technological terms and, perhaps, even in genre terms, 
					significant talent was used to build them. Some may argue 
					that the talent in those games is even superior to today’s 
					games! While these games were much simpler with less 
					features, they still required the same amount of talent and 
					force of creativity that today’s blockbusters do.<br>
					<br>
					The current generation, the High 
					Definition generation, ups the ante with offering different 
					visual displays for different television sets. Considering 
					most people do not really know what ‘high definition’ means 
					(or even how to hook up their consoles to the internet), it 
					is clear that gaming’s complexity is advancing further than 
					most people can adapt.<br>
					<br>
					Today, what is considered an “8-bit 
					game” would be considered a “casual game”. Evidence of this 
					is seen with 8-bit and 16-bit spiritual sequels emerging 
					only on handhelds while the consoles stay near the more 
					complex games. Ports of <i>Super Mario Brothers, Sonic the 
					Hedgehog, </i>and <i>The Legend of Zelda </i>have appeared 
					on handhelds. What used to be classics have become damned as 
					“casual” games. This is the current industry hive-mind view. 
					This is the hardcore view. But what is the reality?<br>
					<br>
					The reality is that all industries, 
					including gaming, exist in a series of tiers. While the 
					tiers of gaming are debatable, I have provided a sufficient 
					list for this discussion:</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="center">
					<img src="Birdmen%20and%20the%20Casual%20Fallacy_files/tiers.gif" border="0" height="384" width="512"></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Let me give examples of these tiers:<br>
					<br>
					<b>Tactical RPG/Strategy- </b><i>Fire 
					Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics, Master of Orion, Command and 
					Conquer, Warcraft, MMORPGs</i><b><br>
					Epic RPG-</b> (‘epic’ meaning very 
					story based) Later <i>Final Fantasy</i> and <i>Dragon Quest</i> 
					games, <i>Ultima</i>, practically most JRPGs<b><br>
					Tactical Shooter-</b> <i>Ghost 
					Recon, SOCOM, Counter-Strike</i><b><br>
					First Person Shooter- </b><i>Halo, 
					Unreal Tournament, Call of Duty</i><b><br>
					Third Person Shooter- </b><i>Gears 
					of War, Grand Theft Auto 3, Resident Evil</i><b><br>
					3D Action Adventure- </b><i>Zelda: 
					Ocarina of Time, Eternal Darkness<br>
					</i><b>3D Platformer- </b><i>Super Mario 
					64, Super Mario Galaxy, Rayman 2</i><b><br>
					Basic RPG- </b>Early <i>Final 
					Fantasy </i>and <i>Dragon Quest. </i>(Likely) <i>Dragon 
					Quest IX</i><b><br>
					Action Adventure- </b><i>Legend of 
					Zelda, Metroid</i><b><br>
					Adventure- </b><i>King’s Quest, 
					Monkey Island</i><b><br>
					2D Platformer- </b><i>Super Mario 
					Brothers, Sonic the Hedgehog</i><b><br>
					Mini-Games / Arcade Style- </b><i>
					Wii Play, Centipede, Galaga, Pac-Man</i><b><br>
					Puzzle- </b><i>Tetris, Dr. Mario</i><b><br>
					Non-Fiction Game- </b><i>Wii Sports, 
					Wii Fit, Brain Age, Nintendogs, </i>cookbook software, how 
					to learn English, etc. <i>Flight Simulator, Sims<br>
					<br>
					</i>Most of these tiers are 
					self-explanatory. The further upmarket one goes, the more 
					one gets drawn into another world. (Before someone writes me 
					and says, “WHERE IS THE RACING TIER, MALSTROM!???”, realize 
					that the list is not intended to be perfect but just show 
					the difference of segments from upmarket to downmarket.) The 
					non-fiction games do not attempt to pull the player into a 
					fiction world. Games such as Brain Age or even Flight 
					Simulator cater to the players’ interests of the real world. 
					Brain Age promises to make you smarter, Wii Fit tries to get 
					you more ‘fit’, and so on. Wii Sports is popular because 
					people actually BELIEVE they are using the same exact sports 
					skills in the game as opposed to just pushing some buttons 
					and playing ‘make-believe’.<br>
					<br>
					The problem is not that games have 
					become more complex over the years; it is that lower tiered 
					games were becoming less and less made. This meant less new 
					gamers and that gaming became less exciting to the 
					mainstream. Games have become more expensive to make which 
					means publishers have huddled toward the upmarket. 
					Meanwhile, the downmarket was being unused until flash games 
					and online simple games caught on big with computer users.<br></p><blockquote cite="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=33498">
					"There are more Flash installs available in people's 
					homes and even on mobile devices than all of the sold 
					consoles of the last two generations put together. It is 
					everywhere…”<br>
					<br>

					Online and Star Wars: Galaxies. SOURCE:

					</i>These downmarket tiers became abandoned 
					and became a ‘Blue Ocean’ where no one was fighting over. 
					Nintendo aimed to become dominant on these lower tiers, the 
					Blue Ocean, first.<br>
					<br>
					Since these lower tier games were the 
					most critical for Nintendo, they put their first string 
					teams to make games such as <i>Nintendogs, Brain Age, Wii 
					Sports, Wii Play</i>, among others. Birdmen, who mistake the 
					downmarket for ‘casual games’ (i.e. retard games), keep 
					putting their third or fourth string teams to make these 
					type of games.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<img src="Birdmen%20and%20the%20Casual%20Fallacy_files/easeofusegonewrong.jpg" border="0" height="473" width="416"><br>
					<br>
					The above picture illustrates the Casual Fallacy well. <i>
					Wii Sports </i>is a game stuffed with complexity (of its 
					physics), replay value, and many game modes. It is what 
					people want: a friendly but powerful game. Consumers want 
					more games like <i>Wii Sports </i>but they get the plastic 
					dog instead. Sure the game is ‘friendly’, but the power 
					behind it is gone. It is a neutered game castrated from any 
					purpose.<br>
					<br>
					If the reader happens to be a member of 
					the NES Generation, compare the games of youth of the 
					so-called ‘kids games’ you got on the computer to <i>Super 
					Mario Brothers </i>and <i>Legend of Zelda</i>. The tailor 
					made ‘kids games’ then ended up plastic dogs while the 
					Nintendo classics ended up being the real dog. Western 
					publishers were stunned that the 1980s children were 
					abandoning their specialized ‘kids games’ to play these 
					‘Japanese games’.<br>
					<br>
					If the reader happens to be a <i>
					hardcore player</i> (oh, that word!), compare games like <i>
					Grand Theft Auto 3 </i>and <i>Halo </i>to wannabe GTA and 
					Halo clones. The wannabe hardcore games will put in 
					gratuitous violence or sex or space aliens to ‘give the game 
					the edge’. These wannabe games end up the plastic dog which 
					annoys hardcore gamers to no end.<br>
					<br>
					Birdmen can only make plastic dogs. In 
					order to make the real dog, they would have to study the 
					concept of flight instead of studying the wings. Passionate 
					developers also tend to create passionate products (which is 
					why Blizzard puts on any business contract that its 
					developers will be free to make the games they want). Will 
					hardcore developers have a passion to create downmarket 
					products? They certainly didn’t become game developers to 
					make competitors to <i>Peggle</i> and online flash games. 
					What we will end up with are more plastic dogs.<br>
					<br>
					Why does the industry not treat the 
					downmarket well? Outside of developer passion, the answer 
					comes down to money. The upmarket games are far more 
					profitable. It is a sure thing that the upmarket will buy 
					the next first person shooter or epic RPG. And since the 
					upmarket games take the most time and are costly, publishers 
					will only put their first string teams on those games. The 
					downmarket, that the industry thinks are its worst 
					customers, sees these games as less profitable and cheaper 
					to make. In their mind, it is perfectly logical to assign 
					their fourth string teams to do these games as if they mess 
					up, little harm is done.<br>
					<br>
					Nintendo considered the downmarket to 
					be the most important and put their first string teams to 
					make games such as <i>Wii Sports</i>. The result is an 
					explosion of sales with these low tier Nintendo titles. The 
					industry looks at this and, idiotically, says, “Oh! A casual 
					gamer boom! Quick! Let us all start making casual games to 
					ride this wave!”<br>
					<br>
					The problems with this worldview are:<br>
					<br>
					1) The lower tier market has always been around. It was just 
					overshot and abandoned as generations passed on. The high 
					growth of online flash games showed this market was always 
					alive and well.<br>
					<br>
					2) The industry still is putting their fourth string teams 
					to work on these games. When they make a Wii game, they make 
					it for ‘casuals’ which means they attempt to make the game 
					playable for retards (in their minds). They dumb everything 
					down, put cutesy generic art and music in, and ultimately 
					make a flash game on steroids. Dull! Dull! Dull!<br>
					<br>
					Don’t take it from me. Miyamoto has 
					told them personally:<blockquote cite="http://www.gamespot.com/pages/unions/read_article.php?topic_id=25522312&amp;union_id=8913">
						<font face="Arial">"If there's only one piece of advice 
					that I could give to the managers of third party companies, 
					it would be that a lot of times it seems that when they're 
					putting games out on Nintendo hardware, those games are 
					being developed by their third-string team or their 
					fourth-string team. Maybe that's because they see those 
					products as being unique projects or somewhat smaller-scale 
					projects. But when Nintendo puts out a title that is 
					designed to really support and sell its hardware, that title 
					is always developed by one of our number one teams. And so I 
					think that when it comes to the question of trying to 
					compete with our software, I would really like to see the 
					parties try to do that with their number one teams rather 
					than with the third- or fourth-string teams. [Laughs.]"<br>

					<b>The ‘Flight’ is in the Developmental Process</b><br>
					<br>
					As someone studying Nintendo recently, I have noticed how 
					the games Nintendo produces are of a very different vein 
					than third parties. Third party games tend to be more hit 
					and miss while Nintendo games almost assuredly have some 
					sort of quality there which makes their games easy buys (and 
					builds up tremendous customer loyalty). Some companies are 
					able to replicate this same effect such as Blizzard. Also, 
					interesting, the Nintendo/Blizzard games tend to hit both 
					upmarket and downmarket users. What are they doing 
					differently?<br>
					<br>
					”People buy Nintendo and Blizzard games because of their 
					franchise worlds.” But other third party games have as rich 
					of a franchise world. “Nintendo and Blizzard have the money 
					to delay their games and perfect them. Most third parties do 
					not have that luxury.” While this is true, it raises the 
					question as to how Nintendo and Blizzard got to where they 
					are. They started small like everyone else and, at a time, 
					also didn’t have the money.<br>
					<br>
					I have found a major clue to the ‘flight’ is in the 
					developmental process.<br>
&nbsp;<p></p>
					<p>
					<img src="Birdmen%20and%20the%20Casual%20Fallacy_files/developmentmodels.png" border="0" height="382" width="376"></p>
					<p>
					Most third parties have the development cycle of the 
					waterfall pictured above. Production is King to them. They 
					focus on utilizing their assets in the most effective 
					manner. Western companies are under more pressure to deliver 
					quarterly results which often results in more rushed games. 
					This approach is not ‘wrong’ as effective production does 
					lower cost and create profit. This also explains the parade 
					of sequels and ‘samey’ type games.<br>
					<br>
					Nintendo and companies like Blizzard use the Spiral where 
					customer satisfaction is King. This leads to delays in 
					production, projects pulled entirely, and constant testing. 
					The result is a product that creates passionate users.<br>
					<br>
					The third one, the question mark, is where the User is King. 
					Many companies know their current ‘waterfall’ production 
					based method has a future of rising costs and declining 
					passion so they are turning to the Internet to make the User 
					as King. These include episodic gaming as well as 
					downloadable content. Will Wright is moving in this 
					direction. The idea is that development cycles begin moving 
					extremely fast as now the user is directly or indirectly 
					involved. Companies are confusing the User as King to mean 
					Customer Satisfaction is King.<br>
					<br>
					”But Malstrom, what is the difference?”<br>
					<br>
					The market did not need <i>Super Mario Brothers</i> until 
					Miyamoto created it. Then, the market could not live without 
					it.<br>
					<br>
					Blizzard studied MMORPGs like <i>Everquest</i> and realized 
					there were too many barriers in the game that kept many 
					people from ‘kicking ass’. “How do we fix this?” the 
					Blizzard developers asked. The market did not need <i>World 
					of Warcraft</i> until Blizzard created it. Then, the market 
					could not live without it.<br>
					<br>
					When Will Wright made <i>The Sims</i>, he did not focus on 
					the ‘waterfall’ effective production method. The market did 
					not need <i>The Sims</i> until Wright created it. Then, the 
					market could not live without it.<br>
					<br>
					When Capcom (back in the good old days where small 
					development teams could harness their passions) made <i>Mega

					<br>
					The difference between Customer Satisfaction and letting the 
					User in control is the matter of surprise which is critical 
					in entertainment. It is ridiculous to ask your customers 
					what surprises them.<br>
					<br>
					High definition games are just pushing development more in 
					the ‘waterfall’ model more due to the rising cost of art 
					assets. With more emphasis on the production model, this 
					will create less interesting games (and explains why the 
					Industry got into a rut as development costs went up over 
					the generations).<br>
					<br>
					It should also be noted that analysts tend to gauge the 
					market based on production methods. You never will read 
					Pachter talking about customer satisfaction but about the 
					production model in the software or hardware company. He 
					will talk about lowering component costs but not the 
					behavior of the customers themselves. <b>Until Third Parties 
					re-tool their development process away from the production 
					based ‘waterfall method’, they will never equal the success 
					or the passionate customers created by Nintendo, Blizzard, 
					and others.</b><br>

					Why are independent games suddenly becoming more appealing 
					than big budget games? Why do retro games hold appeal while 
					their huge budget ‘re-imaginings’ become flops? Why is 
					pixilated <i>Super Mario Brothers </i>revered while slick 
					and voiced modern Mario merely tolerated?<br>
					<br>
					There are diminishing returns with production values. For 
					some reason in entertainment, if the production values are 
					too high, the customers react unfavorably. This phenomenon 
					can be seen in movies and music as well. I personally 
					believe that if the customer senses too much production 
					value, he or she will sense the product attempting to be 
					more style over substance. The customer will then feel 
					‘cheated’.<br>
					<br>
					<i>Wii Sports </i>is an interesting case example. When the 
					game was previewed, gamers said, “OMG! They have no legs! 
					What is with these low poly-models?” Yet, undeniably, that 
					leads to part of the product’s charm.<br>
					<br>
					While the so-called ‘casual games’ were overshot, it should 
					be understood that production values are turning gaming more 
					and more into style over substance. Even the hardcore gamers 
					prefer the ‘good old days’ of <i>Tetris</i> over 
					substance-less games with bloated production values. In 
					order for companies to focus on the ‘flight’ as opposed to 
					the ‘feathers’, they will need to examine to see if their 
					production values are overshooting the market.<br>

					Near the beginning of last generation, stories (such as 
					the above New York Times article) were coming out about the 
					boom in casual gaming. With more than five years to see the 
					trend of increased desire in lower tier games, how could so 
					many game industry managers miss the boat?<br>
					<br>
					<font size="2">Malstrom</font><font size="2"> motions you to come 
					closer. “Shh…” Malstrom whispers.</font><font size="1"> “The real reason why so 
					many in the Industry have rallied about casual gaming since 
					the domination of the Wii is to escape blame for piss poor 
					decision making. They talk of casual gaming like it was a 
					‘new trend’ despite it always existing and its increase on 
					PCs were generating newspaper articles half a decade ago. By 
					describing ‘casual gaming’ as an unforeseen explosion, they 
					save their necks from investors who would have rightly 
					penalized them for making bad business decisions. Pre-Wii, 
					Nintendo talked about appealing to non-gamers and former 
					gamers. Casual gamers are neither of those two.”</font><i><br>
					<br>
					</i>The truth is that regular PC games and console games 
					have begun overshooting the market for quite some time now. 
					What is described as a ‘casual game’ used to be the ‘bread 
					and butter’ of the Game Industry not too many years ago.<br>
					<br>
					The big problem with current research methods is that they 
					are polling active gamers. What about the non-active ones? 
					And are the more hardcore game genres in true decline or are 
					the games overshooting the market and generating more and 
					more former gamers? (It should be noted that Nintendo 
					focused their market research on non-active gamers including 
					non-gamers and former gamers. Nintendo never aimed at 
					capturing ‘casual gamers’ in the same context that birdmen 
					speak today.)<br>
					<br>
					The most important thing to keep in mind with ‘casual 
					gaming’ on PCs is that revenue is generally made from 
					advertisements. Currently, there is an advertisement crisis 
					as less and less people watch television or read newspapers. 
					Consumers now have greater control on being able to edit out 
					advertisements. Advertising agencies are desperate to reach 
					people. It is no surprise that advertisers are rushing over 
					one another to get to these ‘casual games’.<br>
					<br>
					The problem is that advertisers will want these games more 
					than the consumers will. “But look at the growth, Malstrom!” 
					Trends are double edged. It is good to be in front of them 
					but bad when one is on the wrong side. Low tier game growth 
					will not go on forever especially with everyone treating it 
					like a new gold rush. Soon, advertisers will be pushing 
					these games more than consumers demand.<br>
					<br>
					While Nintendo accurately interpreted the growth in low tier 
					gaming on PCs to mean the traditional market was overshot, 
					this ‘Blue Ocean’ would allow Nintendo to perform the 
					nastiest business move conceived. It will be Microsoft and 
					Sony’s worst nightmare.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Difference Between World-Views</b></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Nintendo’s worldview is simple: aim at 
					making hits on the downmarket to make the Wii platform 
					dominate the lower tiers. Then slowly move upmarket.<br>
					<br>
					The rest of the industry has a 
					completely different worldview: view the ‘explosion’ in 
					downmarket games as a unique phenomenon (in this case, the 
					fictional “Casual Games Phenomenon”), and then assign many 
					teams to make these ‘casual games’. Instead of trying to 
					understand Nintendo’s flight, they are putting on wings and 
					trying to flap. Wii gamers become frustrated while 
					Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 gamers laugh and say, “If you 
					want to play REAL games, buy a real <i>gaming</i> console! 
					Hah! Hah!”<br>
					<br>
					Go back in time and look at the DS 
					which was hated by the industry (who analysts referred to it 
					as Nintendo doing another Virtual Boy). The industry did not 
					understand the platform and just dumped many PSP ports or 
					mini-game collections on it. While this was going on, 
					Nintendo focused on the downmarket with games such as <i>
					Brain Age</i> and <i>Nintendogs</i> as well as a few tiers 
					above that with <i>New Super Mario Brothers.</i> After a 
					year on the market, <i>Super Mario Kart DS</i> and <i>Animal 
					Crossing DS</i> came out. As you know, games like <i>Brain 
					Age </i>and <i>Nintendogs </i>became huge hits which 
					attracted new gamers. And these new gamers then swam 
					upmarket to turn <i>Mario Kart DS, New Super Mario Brothers,
					</i>and <i>Animal Crossing DS</i> into huge hits (than they 
					would have been without those lower tier games). The 
					installed base for the DS surged which attracted more third 
					party support but mostly meant support for upper market 
					games such as <i>Dragon Quest IX </i>and the Final Fantasy 
					and Dragon Quest remakes. As the DS swam upstream, the 
					uppermarket games that were coming on the PSP began to be 
					stolen by the DS.<br>
					<br>
					The Wii is advancing in the same way. 
					Nintendo focused on the downmarket with games such as <i>Wii 
					Sports, Wii Play, </i>and <i>Wii Fit</i> which all became 
					hits. Third parties become confused and made mini-game 
					compilations. After a year, slightly higher tier Nintendo 
					games come out such as <i>Mario Kart Wii </i>and <i>Super 
					Smash Brothers Brawl </i>and <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i>. 
					These games will become bigger hits because of the success 
					of lower tier games such as <i>Wii Sports</i> sending new 
					consumers upstream. Just as the DS has become the darling of 
					hardcore gamers, so too will the Wii as the system moves 
					upstream.<br>
					<br>
					The birdmen eventually understood the 
					DS. They realized it wasn’t about making retarded games 
					(what they nicely label ‘casual games’) but hitting 
					different tiers. They could make a simple RPG or a puzzle 
					game to satisfy those customers on that tier. They realized 
					casual gaming does not necessarily mean passion-less gaming.<br>
					<br>
					While the journalists and analysts 
					parrot one another with “casual gaming” speeches and 
					rhetoric, keep in mind Nintendo’s plan. The strategy is to 
					start with the Blue Ocean, seize and dominate the lower tier 
					(which the industry doesn’t really care for anyway), and 
					then <i>slowly move upstream</i>.<br>
					<br>
					What happens when Nintendo moves 
					upstream? Competitors have two choices:<br>
					<br>
					1) <b>Flee.</b> Many companies will 
					gladly ‘cede’ this new market. After all, this new market is 
					not very profitable to the competitor and, besides, the 
					competitor clearly is getting tons of money through the 
					upmarket. While this choice works for the short term, the 
					problem is that the encroaching company will swim upstream 
					and begin to take customers away. Fleeing to the upmarket 
					means ceding more and more of the market to the newcomer. 
					Eventually, the competitor will have nowhere else to flee 
					and will go out of business or be reduced to a niche.<br>
					<br>
					2) <b>Fight.</b> Some companies realize that fleeing will 
					ensure their demise so they stay and fight the newcomer for 
					that market. However, the newcomer is patient for growth but 
					impatient for profit. The competitor will likely be unable 
					to defend that tier due to the newcomer gaining more profit. 
					The battle becomes attrition until angry investors let the 
					company’s managers know they do not enjoy them wasting so 
					much money fighting over a market that has little profit in 
					it. The investors will say the upmarket has plenty of profit 
					to satisfy the company’s needs for growth. So, eventually, 
					the competitor will decide to flee upmarket.<br>
					<br>
					Imagine Nintendo using <i>The Blue 
					Ocean Strategy </i>to gain a foothold in the market, attract 
					new gamers, former gamers, and dominate on the downmarket. 
					Once successful there, Nintendo slowly moves upstream with 
					superior business models which prove more profitable than 
					the competitors (that attracts more and more third parties). 
					As Nintendo moves upstream into the upper markets, Sony and 
					Microsoft either fight or end up retreating upstream. Since 
					Nintendo has a more profitable business model, they will win 
					any fight over a tier with Microsoft and Sony. As Sony and 
					Microsoft retreat upmarket, Nintendo follows. Eventually, 
					Sony and Microsoft either become niches or leave the gaming 
					market entirely.<br>
					<br>
					“NOOOOO!!!!” a hardcore gamer screams 
					in sudden realization.<br>
					<br>
					You see it, don’t you? You now are 
					suddenly seeing the Big Picture. Now, when you hear Sony 
					says that they think <i>Final Fantasy XIII </i>or <i>Metal 
					Gear Solid 4</i> to ‘save them’, you realize they are 
					relying on the upmarket. Just now, Nintendo announced paid 
					online services and even download content. “What does this 
					mean?” asks a reader. It is a sign that Nintendo is moving 
					upstream into the upmarket, into the more hardcore areas.<br>
					<br>
					The tsunamis were just the beginning. <i>Malstrom puffs on 
					his cigar while standing in knee-deep water. He points to 
					you. </i>Remember this room? Here are the statues of all of 
					gaming’s heroes. <i>Malstrom held up out his palm, and you 
					see a drop of water fall into it. You look up to see the 
					roof leaking.</i> “The water is rising!” you shout.<br>
					<br>
					Yes. The Old Era will soon be gone. Enjoy its last gasp. We 
					are in the midst of a huge shift where little will be as it 
					once was.<br>
					<br>
					But my hope is that people will stop 
					being birdmen. Instead of looking at Nintendo’s games, their 
					marketing, or their online and say, “Oh? That is for casual 
					gamers! This means they are going for people who don’t 
					normally play games! LOL! I AM SO INSIGHTFUL!!!” they will 
					instead look at Nintendo starting at the bottom of the tiers 
					and moving their way up.<br>
					<br>
					A thoughtful reader asks, “Malstrom, 
					this is an interesting and, indeed, ingenious strategy 
					Nintendo is using of creating a very profitable business 
					model, aiming to dominate the lower tiers, and then move up. 
					The competitors cannot compete because they will not be as 
					profitable so they will lose the attrition wars and can only 
					retreat upmarket. What is the name of this strategy?”<br>
					<br>
					It is called <i>Disruption</i>.<br>
					<br>
					I could find only one voice that 
					appeared to see the disruption for what is was. Unlike 
					others, who in hindsight described the Wii-mote as the 
					‘Nintendo disruption’, he recognized it in the software as 
					far back when the DS hit its stride:<i><br>
					</i></p><blockquote cite="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=17739">

					set to prove vital to the coming console generation, <b>so 
					too will this disruptive trend in software be key -</b> and
					<b>the ability</b> of publishers and platform-holders <b>to

					<br>
					I admit I find myself in astonishment. 
					This is the process I am seeing:<b><br>
					<br>
					Nintendo:</b> “We are following the 
					strategy of disruption!”<b><br>
					NPD: </b>“Nintendo wins!”<b><br>
					Journalist:</b> “How are you 
					winning, Nintendo?”<br>

					here, analysts and third parties?”<br>
					<b>Analyst:</b> “It is a casual gamer boom!”<br>
					<b>Third Parties:</b> “OMG! Easy money! Quick guys, everyone 
					start making casual games!”<br>
					<b>Nintendo:</b> “We are following the strategy of 
					disruption!”<br>
					<b>Journalist:</b> (philosophically) “Will casual games 
					cause the downfall of the hardcore games? Let me write many 
					editorials about this!”<b><br>
					Analyst:</b> (philosophically) “Is 
					the casual game boom a fad? Let us pontificate over this.”<br>
					<b>Third Parties:</b> “Hey guys! How you like my casual 
					games? They sure are snazzy! I will make millions! I am such 
					the business whiz!”<br>
					<b>Nintendo: </b>“We are following the strategy of 
					disruption!”<br>
					<b>Journalist: </b>(scratches head) “You hear something?”<br>
					<b>Analyst: </b>“It was just Nintendo speaking. They are 
					saying the same thing.”<br>
					<b>Journalist:</b> “Yeah! Haha! Same old marketing speak. I 
					am so much smarter about business than Nintendo. In my next 
					interview with Iwata, I’ll give him some business lessons.”<br>
					<b>Third Parties:</b> (cries) “Oh no! My casual games are 
					not selling!”<br>
					<b>Journalist: </b>“Obviously, this is because people buy 
					Nintendo consoles for Nintendo games.”<br>
					<b>Analyst: </b>“Nintendo needs to assist these third 
					parties in getting their casual games to sell.”<b><br>
					Third Parties:</b> “That’s right! 
					They need to do what WE want them to!”<b><br>
					Nintendo: </b>“We are following the

					<b>Journalist:</b> (yawns) “Is that all they say? (becomes 
					excited) Ohhh! Look! A new hardcore game is being made with 
					fresh textures.” (runs off)<br>
					<b>Analyst: </b>“Obviously, Sony and Microsoft are branching 
					with casual games themselves. Poor Nintendo. Too bad they 
					are out of tricks. I expect Playstation 3 to be surpassing

					<b>Third Parties:</b> “My casual games aren’t selling? Why!? 
					I do not understand!”<br>
					<br>
					Is it not amazing how everyone talks 
					about the casual gamer boom except Nintendo? Instead, 
					Nintendo keeps talking disruption while everyone either 
					ignores these quotes or misinterpret ‘disruption’ to mean 
					‘change’ or ‘innovation’.<br>

					Mr. Levine, drawing on the experience 
					of the 80s, understands the concept of upstreaming (or as he 
					says ‘gateway’ drug). Even back then, ‘hardcore’ games such 
					as <i>Defender</i> sold which no one thought was possible 
					and plenty of ‘hardcore’ RPG and strategy games were 
					blossoming on the computers (from the upstream of arcades 
					and the home console gamers).<br>
					<br>
					What no one is pointing out that this deliberate upstreaming 
					process, of ‘gateway drugs’, is the big picture of 
					Nintendo’s strategy. The hardcore gamer, enraged that all 
					these “non-games” are coming out and his beloved HD consoles 
					are struggling, screams “This is madness!” No, it is 
					disruption. Nintendo is winning not because it is attacking 
					at the top and going on down but by attacking from the 
					bottom and moving up.<br>
					<br>
					One game journalist sniffed the truth and shuddered:<br>
					</p><blockquote cite="http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/03/18/new-term-from-nintendo-bridge-games/">

					“But is it? Bridging casual and hardcore gamers implies each 
					is approaching a game from opposite directions — but having 
					fun on a common ground. That doesn’t mean the “novice” will 
					ever end up crossing to the other side. “Gateway games” and 
					“bridge games” may not be one and the same.<br>
					<br>
					“Nintendo’s announced definition of a “bridge” game isn’t 
					necessarily Wii specific, either. Does a “bridge” game mean 
					another player has to be a part of the action? I had several

					simply because the game was so immersive, even to a viewer. 
					They never played it, but they experienced it.<br>
					<br>
					“So far, the gameplay of “bridge games” falls on the simpler

					<br>
					“Do they need to?”<br>
					<br>
					Patrick Klepek, MTV gaming post. SOURCE: http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/03/18/new-term-from-nintendo-bridge-games/
						</font></blockquote>You can smell the fear. Klepek connects ‘bridge game’ and 
					‘gateway drug’ and becomes alarmed. Why, if Nintendo made 
					bridges for low tier users to go upward, it would destroy 
					the Hardcore Kingdom. Instead of facing this fear head on, 
					Klepek attempts to rationalize this possibility of 
					upstreaming away (similar to how everyone said, before 
					launch, Wii would just sell to Nintendo fans and have three 
					year lifecycle max to not deal with the fear that Wii could 
					reshape the market like DS did). He says ‘gateway drugs’ and 
					‘bridge games’ may not be the same. But what is he basing 
					this on? HIS OPINION.<br>
					<br>
					”What’s wrong with that, Malstrom? Are we not allowed to 
					have opinions?”<br>
					<br>
					What is wrong is that this is the business strategy arena, 
					not ‘is this game fun?’ arena the journalists tend to reside 
					in. Opinions don’t matter in the business strategy arena. 
					Strategies mean outcomes. Klepek doesn’t ask anyone at 
					Nintendo. He attempts to rationalize the possibility of 
					upstreaming away.<br>
					<br>
					Since hardcore love ‘immersion’ games, he attempts to pin 
					bridge games on people watching him play Resident Evil. 
					Then, he attempts to try to dismiss it further by saying 
					Nintendo could not possibly make a bridge game out of Pikmin 
					or The Legend of Zelda without scaring off the hardcore. 
					Unfortunately for Klepek, Nintendo did just that with Zelda: 
					Phantom Hourglass. The next Pikmin is practically guaranteed 
					to be a ‘bridge’ title as well. (I sent an email to him 
					asking him his thoughts on the DS simple games being the 
					gateway drugs to the bigger games to eventually stealing the 
					precious ‘hardcore’ titles like <i>Dragon Quest 9</i>. He 
					never replied.) <br>
					<br>
					As you can see from above, ‘disruption’ will not be the 
					conclusion in anyone in this industry for Nintendo’s 
					success. They will, instead, mistake correlation for 
					causation, see these ‘casual games’, and think all they need 
					to do is make ‘casual games’ for instant money.<br>
					<br>
					You can tell much about someone by their criticisms. The 
					Industry criticizing the Wii because it is a “fad” aptly 
					describes the Industry. That is all they do, chase one fad 
					after the next. Now, my birdmen, what is the fad are you 
					going to chase once the ‘casual games’ have run their 
					course? Why would someone invest in an entertainment company 
					that is doing exactly what everyone else is? Imitation is 
					suicide, and mimicry is the masking of the talent-less.<br>
