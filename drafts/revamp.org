What I want is a complete revamp. Not so much style-wise, but content-wise.

Technical improvements:
- [ ] auto-generate categories
- [ ] template for "being worked on"

Here's what I want to express:
** Reflections
Needs a better name.

*** Anatta, Anicca, Dukkha
**** Anatta
Main problem: phenomenology. What do you mean with "atman"?
**** Anicca
Time theory. Changing of sensations. Merely practical point?
**** Dukkha
Attitude. Wireheading.
*** Causality
What is causality? Does it exist? Does "epiphenomenal" make any sense?
*** Christ Myth [0/3]
Mapping all the major arguments.
- [ ] arguments pro/con, with strength
- [ ] collect sources
- [ ] compare with similar figure - Socrates
*** Crucifixion
Not nearly detailed enough. Needs more research, I guess?
*** Dennett's ConExp [0/2]
- [ ] reread
- [ ] more detailed criticism (probably only meaningful after a basic zombie
      article is up)
*** Free Will [0/3]
- [ ] Determinism / Quantum Mechanics
- [ ] Freedom Evolves
- [ ] Why care at all? Dissolving the question.
*** Great Filter [0/4]
This is mostly a literature review. Only my likelihood estimates are by me.
- [ ] Hanson
- [ ] Katja
- [ ] Past Filters
- [ ] Future Filters
*** Julian Jaynes
That'll take some effort to clean up. :)
*** Memes
**** Letting Go of Music
Needs a complete revamp. Totally broken, but interesting point, I think. Can be
rescued.
**** Memetic Hazards
Also note depression.
*** Logic and Math are Lies [0/3]
Ok, polemical enough. :D

- [ ] problems with Classical Logic
- [ ] against infinites
- [ ] against the axiom of choice
*** Moral Theory
Is there anything besides preferences?

Unity of Knowledge and Action?

**** Falsifications
- [ ] there is instrinsic value
- [ ] preferences don't exist
- [ ] through some magic all beings have the same terminal preferences
*** Occam's Razor
Which Razor to use? What's "simpler"?
Depends on prior. Complexity prior (code? data?). Kolmogorov. Pragmatic.
*** On Purpose
*** Phenomenology
**** Justification
Always being right.
**** Unbroken Consciousness
**** Indexing Problem
*** Survey, Gospel
Better organization, but always nice to have a short overview.
*** Why Gnosticism?
Dissolving the attraction from 1st/3rd person phenomenology.
*** Zombies and Algorithms and Qualia, oh my!
**** Only One Quale
**** What about Physicalism?
**** Zombie Argument by Chalmers
** Experiments
*** Concentration [0/7]
- [ ] caffeine
- [ ] fat, protein, sugar
- [ ] exercise
- [ ] st. john's wort
- [ ] sunlight
- [ ] tyrosine
- [ ] meditation
  metta, vipassana (all kinds), zazen
*** Happiness [0/8]
- [ ] medication
- [ ] metta
- [ ] gratitude
- [ ] cbt / rationality
- [ ] vipassana
- [ ] sunlight
- [ ] exercise
- [ ] food (sugar, fat)
*** Language Learningâ€¯[0/4]
- [ ] SRS (cloze deletion!)
- [ ] immersion
- [ ] bilingual vs. monolingual
- [ ] material
*** Sleep [0/3]
- [ ] Polyphasic sleep, biphasic sleep
- [ ] caffeine
- [ ] random hacks
*** Speed-Reading
Essentially fine, just proofread it and put a stronger qualification on it.
*** SRS [0/4]
- [ ] usefulness
- [ ] one deck / multiple decks
- [ ] card design
- [ ] random hacks
** Software
Main problem: content. I just don't program that much recently. Still, might
demonstrate some minor stuff.
