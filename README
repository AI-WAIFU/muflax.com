Ceci n'est pas un lisez-moi.

Just a few short notes how this stuff works so I don't forget it over time.

Structure
---------
    layout -> templates
    out -> result, upload this
    src -> all content files
    styles -> css files

Each directory in src is a separate (sub-)category. It contains each content
page as a separate text file (*.pdc) of the following form:
    % title
    [content in (pandoc-enhanced) Markdown markup]

Each directory also contains a meta.yaml specifying the necessary metadata, like
the category name, some layout data and so on. Note that each directory inherits
all unset data from its parent.

Any additional data, like images, reside in the same dir as their .pdc and are
just copied with them. (Everything except *.pdc and meta.yaml is.)

Additionally, changelog.pdc is used to build the rss.xml.

Process
-------
webifier.py goes through all directories in src, reads meta.yaml, generates all
necessary metadata out of it and then takes every *.pdc, pipes it through pandoc
and tidy (adding data if necessary) and finally puts the result into out. 

Also, an index.html is generated for every category.

Finally, changelog.html is parsed, transformed into an RSS feed and put at
out/rss.xml.

Done!
